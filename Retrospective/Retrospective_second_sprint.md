RETROSPECTIVE (Team 2)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 4 - 4
- Total points committed vs. done 26-26
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 72 - 71.45

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#5_Describe_hut   |   4      |  5     |  8h          |     8h30m         |
| _#6_Describe_parking      |     4    |   5     |       8h     |   9h           |
| _#7_Search_hut      |  4       |   8     |        13h    |    14h15m          |
| _#8_Link_start/arrival      |   3      |  8      |     8h       |     5h30m         |
   

- Hours per task average (estimate and actual): 
37/15= 2.47; 37.25/15= 2.48 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: 
- 37/37.25 -> 1 - 0.99 = 0.01

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 4h30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 21
  
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 3h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
We did not separate in the planning the task for unit tests and integration tests; in general, in this sprint we have estimated better than last sprint

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Giving simple task helps our estimation; a better planning help us to work better

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able  to achieve? 
Better coordination with the team members 
Better planning
Better division of the work between group
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
In time estimation we didnâ€™t considered the time to fix bugs and test again the code

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Separate Integration and Unit Test in the tasks 
Cleaning code and improving quality in back end and frontend 


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
We did a good team work
