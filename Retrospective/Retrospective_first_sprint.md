## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:  4 / 4
- Total points committed vs. done: 65 / 65
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 72 / 78:45

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing 
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_Browse hikes   |    3     |  13     |      10      |          9:30    |
| _#1_Describe hikes      |   4      |    5    |      14      |       15:30       |
_#2_Register      |    7     |    13    |     19       |      18:15        |
_#3_See hike's details     |    3     |     34   |     10       |         7     |
   


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): 13.25 - 12.5
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: 0.32

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 6
  - Total hours spent 6
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 9
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 2
  - Total hours spent 2
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 2
  - Total hours spent 2
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

We did not consider the time needed for learning the usage of the external API used (for example to upload the map of an hike) or other tecnologies; fixing bugs cost us unexcepted time


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Positive: keep it simple stupid (KISS)
Negative: We have to bee more swift in our communication

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

It is the firs sprint
  

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We have to improve the estimation, considering all the details of our tasks; we have to divide the work more efficiently; we have to improve the management of the timesheet

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We have implemented all the user stories planned
The team has a positive mental attitude
